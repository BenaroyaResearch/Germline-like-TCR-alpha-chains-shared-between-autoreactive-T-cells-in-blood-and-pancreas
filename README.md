This repository contains data and code needed to generate the manuscript figures. The data arre organized into four folders:

1) Figure_code. Contains R scripts to generate the graphs in the Main and Supplemental Figures. The code references data contained in a workiing directory on a Mac Desktop (setwd("/Users/peterlinsley/Desktop/PIT_TCR_paper_code/data"). There are two sub folders in this directory, one containing code for the final figures and the other containing additional code that was used for generation of the figures.

2) data. Contains all  data files used in generation fo teh figures.

3) Figure_PDFs. Contains PDF files for the individuaal panels in each figure. 

4) models. Contains .pdb files used for figures utilizing TCR models generated using TCRmodel2.
